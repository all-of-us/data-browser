/**
 * Helper to assert the React.CSSProperties type for all properties in a tuple,
 * while maintaining property names. This will fail compilation if input CSS
 * properties are invalid and will avoid the need for a type assertion on the
 * output. Also makes the properties readonly.
 *
 * This is a workaround to an issue in the Typescript compiler which should
 * eventually be fixed: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/11152.
 *
 * This approach works only with a single-level nested tuples currently:
 * const styles = reactStyles({
 *   style1: {color: 'red'},
 *   style2: {color: 'blue', position: 'relative'}
 * });
 *
 * Alternatively, style tuples can be cast individually (with arbitrary nesting):
 * const styles = {
 *   style1: {color: 'red'} as React.CssProperties,
 *   style2: {color: 'blue', position: 'relative'} as React.CssProperties
 * };
