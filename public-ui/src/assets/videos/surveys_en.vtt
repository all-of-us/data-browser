I’m thinking about joining the <i>All of Us</i> Research Program, but I’m curious about the surveys.

00:06.000 --> 00:17.700
I understand why measurements and my medical records are important to researchers, but I want to know more about what kinds of questions the surveys ask and how that information is displayed.

00:18.000 --> 00:28.700
I can see three different surveys that program participants have taken about their lifestyle, their overall health, and the basics, such as demographic information.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.700
I’m interested in the overall health questions, so I view the survey.

00:34.000 --> 00:47.700
I can see how many people filled out the survey and each question that was asked, along with the answer options and how many people chose each answer.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.700
I can even click each response to see charts with age and sex information for the people that chose that response.

00:55.000 --> 10:05.00
Researchers may also find information that allows them to develop hypotheses or assess the feasibility of the data set for their studies.
