Are you curious about the data being collected by the All of Us Research Program? 

00:06.000 --> 00:09.500
I was, and Iâ€™ve found that the Data Browser is a great place to start! 

00:10.000 --> 00:25.500
It provides an overview of the different types of data that have been collected from participants like me, including our electronic medical record information, survey responses, and the physical measurements taken as part of program enrollment.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.500
I was assured that my information would be kept confidential and only accessible by program staff and researchers.

00:33.000 --> 00:43.500
So when I heard about the Data Browser, a tool that any member of the public could use to look at data, I wanted to make sure it looks safe and that my individual data will be kept private.

00:44.000 --> 00:54.500
By browsing through the different options, I see that for each data type the information has been grouped by both sex and age.

00:55.000 --> 01:04.500
There are many individuals represented in each group with no identifiable information available, and the counts are rounded to the nearest 20.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.500
There is no information that could help someone identify an individual, so anyone can safely explore without risking the privacy of any participants.
